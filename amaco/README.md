## Product Range

The scraper found products from V-301 (Ivory Beige) to V-392 (Blood Orange), covering the full range of AMACO Velvet Underglaze colors including:

- Earth tones (Ivory Beige, Terra Cotta, Straw)
- Primary colors (Yellow, Red, Blue)
- Pastels (Lavender, Lilac, Baby Blue)
- Bright colors (Electric Blue, Bright Red, Flame Orange)
- Neutrals (White, Black, Gray)

All products include direct links to high-resolution cone chart images hosted on AMACO's CDN, showing how each underglaze performs at different firing temperatures (Cone 05-10).

## Swatch Generation

The swatches are automatically generated by cropping the cone chart images:
- **386×251 images**: Cropped from (105,102) to 113×108 pixels
- **386×150 images**: Cropped from (60,45) to 110×105 pixels  
- **Other sizes**: Fallback to solid white 50×50 pixels
- **Final size**: All swatches resized to 50×50 pixels for consistency

## Color Extraction

The color extraction process samples colors from the swatches:
- **Left sample**: 25% to the left of center (unglazed appearance)
- **Right sample**: 25% to the right of center (glazed appearance)
- **Averaging**: 5×5 pixel region with slight blur for color averaging
- **Integration**: Colors added to colors.json under "Amaco Velvet Underglaze" brand

**Result**: 45 underglaze entries added to the main colors.json file with both unglazed and glazed color values.
